# Sequence Learning

## How to Write a Peer Review

Korbinian Riedhammer

---

# Peer Reviews

- play a vital role in ensuring quality and consistency in research
- <https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/guidelines-reviewers>
- <https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html>
- types of peer review
	- *open:* both authors and reviewers are known
	- *single-blind:* authors known, reviewers anonymous (most common)
	- *double-blind:* authors and reviewers anonymous
	- benefits and drawbacks?

---

# Peer Reviews

- journals are typically merit-based: 
	- if it's a good paper, it will be published
	- journal quality typically measured in impact factor
- conferences are typically ranked-merit-based: 
	- the _N_ best papers will be accepted
	- conference quality typically measured in impact factor and acceptance rate
- often a mix between linear scales, categories and free-form text
	- accept, minor changes, major changes, reject
	- novelty: 1-5
	- comments to the author


???

- gender and personality bias
- hard to hide identity, esp. in narrow fields (--> data!)

---

# The First Read-Through

_The first read-through is a skim-read for an initial impression._

- read the title and abstract; what is the paper about, which data and algorithms are used?
- skim-read the remainder of the article
	- What is the main question addressed by the research? Is it relevant and interesting?
	- How original is the topic? What does it add to the subject area compared with other published material?
	- Is the paper well written? Is the text clear and easy to read?
	- Are the conclusions consistent with the evidence and arguments presented? Do they address the main question posed?
	- If the author is disagreeing significantly with the current academic consensus, do they have a substantial case? If not, what would be required to make their case credible?
	- If the paper includes tables or figures, what do they add to the paper? Do they aid understanding or are they superfluous?

---

# Spotting Potential Major Flaws

Watch out for potential flaws!

- insufficient data or incorrect partitioning (training and test?)
- statistically non-significant variations
- unclear data tables or figures
- contradictory data that either are not self-consistent or disagree with the conclusions
- confirmatory data that adds little, if anything, to current understanding - unless strong arguments for such repetition are made

---

# Concluding the First Read-Through

- while reading, take notes:
	- are the introduction and related work sections well-written and organized??
	- could you follow the explanations and conclusions?
	- are the data and methods appropriate?
	- is the paper technically sound?
	- does the data and evidence support the conclusions?
	- are references adequately 
- write down two paragraphs:
	- what are key strengths of the article, if any?
	- what is the main weakness of the article, if any?
- would you accept or reject the paper based on these findings?

_This part will be covered by our student peer review._

---

# The Second Read-Through

If you decide the paper should be accepted, go over the paper again, this time in-depth.

Make notes and comments in reference to line, figure or table numbers.

Analyze section-by-section:

- Introduction: topic, objective/hyopothesis and main contributions?
- Related Work: complete and recent?
- Data: description, available/accessible, partitioning?
- Method: necessary detail to follow argument, technically sound?
- Experiments: relevant to objective/hypothesis, replicable/reproducible, valid evaluation schedule, technical details?
- Discussion and Conclusion: does the evidence support the conclusions?

---

# The Second Read-Through (cont'd)

Check for consistency and correctness:

- are there any language issues or typos?
- are there any unclear formulations that need improvement?
- does the math check out?
- are the references correctly cited? (authors, title, journal, year, ...)
- are all figures and tables correctly referenced and described?
- are there any factual errors or invalid arguments?

# Sequence Learning 2020 Review Form

Example paper \#31337 (see Moodle)

Let's gauge...
- technical merit
- key strengths of the paper (paragraph)
- main weakness of the paper (paragraph)
- clarity of presentation
- quality of references
- reproducibility
