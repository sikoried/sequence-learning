# Sequence Learning

## Practical Considerations

Korbinian Riedhammer

---

# Choice of Language

- R: the language of statisticians
	+ good file i/o for medium sized data
	+ statistical tests built-in
	+ ...a math scripting language
- python: the new Perl...
	+ incredible library choices
	+ numpy for numeric computation
	+ scipy/sklearn for basic ML
	+ pandas for data analysis/science tasks
	+ TF, Keras, ...

---

# Choice of Language

- c++: if performance matters
	+ actual implementation for most toolkits
	+ high-performance computing
	+ "real" programming language
- Scala: language of microservices
	+ functional language
	+ scalable frameworks (akka)
	+ full Java support


...dependent on your architectorial considerations!

---

# Data IO

## Surprisingly the hardest part...

Examples for python.

---

# Python Pickle

- Compare to basic Java serialization (JPA)
- Inefficient (slow, disk hungry)
- Security concern (serializes the classes)
- Easy to use :-)

```python
import pickle

data = {'some': 'key', 'value': 123}
pickle.dump(data, open('data.pkl', 'wb'))

data = pickle.load(open('data.pkl', 'rb'))
```

---

# Pandas

- Python data analytics toolkit ([tutorial](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15/10min.html), [indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html))
- `Series` and `DataFrame`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([1, 3, 3, 7])
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6,4), index=dates, columns=list('ABCD'))
```

---

# Tensorflow TFRecord

- Uses [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
- Inefficient, particularly for sequence data
- Helps with partitioning and shuffling
- A [bit complicated to use](https://medium.com/mostly-ai/tensorflow-records-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them-c46bc4bbb564)
- <https://www.skcript.com/svr/why-every-tensorflow-developer-should-know-about-tfrecord/>

# Weight Initialization

![weights]({{site.baseurl}}/09-toolkits/weights.png)

---

# Weight Initialization: 0

- identical gradients
- effectively linear model

---

# Weight Inititalization: Random

Usually the best choice (seed for reproducibility!)

## Vanishing Gradient

- Gradient becomes very small (and thus numerically instable)
- Sigmoid and tanh functions prone to VG for large weights

## Exploding Gradient

- Opposite: gradient becomes too large for large weights and small activations
- Oscillating cost function

---

# Best Practices

<https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-best-practices-1-weight-initialization-14e5c0295b94>

- Use ReLU: gradient is 0 for negative, 1 for positive examples
- Use heuristics for weight initialization
- Apply gradient clipping
